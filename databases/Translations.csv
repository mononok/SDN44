"1dc8d12c:42cbd62e:aaf9bebf:914d598b";"US";"Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat, Scottish peer of the kingdom, was an Oxford graduate and a young reserve army captain when he was recalled in service in 1939. Posted in his clan's own regiment, the Lovat Scouts, he requested in 1940 a transfer to the newly created commandos. Attached to 4 Commando, he took part in the Lofoten (Norway) and Hardelot (France) raids. During the failed Dieppe landing, in 1942, now commanding 4 Commando, his unit was among the few to complete its objectives, then managed to reembark most of its men. When the 1st Special Service Brigade (aka Commando Brigade, for the commandos hated the SS acronym) was formed in 1944, Lord Lovat was appointed as its brigadier. Although coming in the second wave at Sword Beach, Lovat's commandos soon encountered tough resistance when penetrating inland to secure their objectives. Lovat famously landed with his piper Bill Millin playing the bagpipes against army regulations, for Lovat was of the opinion that the latter didn't applied to them Scotsmen ! Later in the day, Lovat and his men managed to reach Pegasus Bridge, two minutes and half late on schedule for which Lord Lovat apologized. Six days later, he was seriously wounded by friendly artillery fire, ending the war for him.";"Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat, Scottish peer of the Kingdom, was an Oxford graduate and a young reserve army captain when he was recalled to service in 1939. Posted to his clan's own regiment, the Lovat Scouts, he requested in 1940 a transfer to the newly created Commandos. Attached to No. 4 Commando, he took part in the Lofoten (Norway) and Hardelot (France) raids. During the failed Dieppe landing in 1942, now leading No. 4 Commando, his unit was among the few to complete its objectives and manage to re-embark most of its men. When the 1st Special Service Brigade (aka Commando Brigade, as the commandos hated the SS acronym) was formed in 1944, Lord Lovat was appointed as its brigadier. Although engaging in the second wave at Sword Beach, Lovat's commandos soon encountered tough resistance when penetrating inland to secure their objectives. Lovat famously landed with his piper Bill Millin playing the bagpipes against army regulations, as Lovat was of the opinion that such regulations did not apply to Scotsmen! Later in the day, Lovat and his men managed to reach Pegasus Bridge, two and a half minutes behind schedule – for which Lord Lovat apologised. Six days later, he was seriously wounded by friendly artillery fire, thus ending his involvement in the war."
